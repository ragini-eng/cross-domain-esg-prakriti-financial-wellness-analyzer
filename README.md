# 🌱 Cross-Domain ESG–Prakriti Financial Wellness Analyzer

## 📌 About the Project
This project explores **financial wellness from a behavioral and sustainability-driven perspective** by integrating  
**ESG principles (Environmental, Social, Governance)** with **Prakriti-based behavioral profiling**.

Instead of evaluating financial health only through income, expenses, or savings, this project focuses on **how human behavior and sustainability awareness shape financial decisions over time**.

The objective is simple:  
to transform raw financial and behavioral data into **clear, actionable insights** that support **long-term, responsible financial well-being**.

This project brings together **finance, behavioral analytics, ESG concepts, and data visualization** into a single, practical analytics solution.

## 🎯 Why I Built This
Most financial wellness tools today follow a *one-size-fits-all* approach. They rarely answer deeper questions such as:

- Why do people with similar incomes show very different financial outcomes?
- How do behavioral patterns influence spending, saving, and risk-taking?
- Are financial decisions aligned with long-term sustainability goals?
- Can financial wellness analysis be both **personalized and responsible**?

This project was built to explore these questions by combining **behavioral context and ESG thinking** with data analytics.
