# 🌱 Cross-Domain ESG–Prakriti Financial Wellness Analyzer

---

## 1. 📌 About the Project
This project explores **financial wellness from a behavioral and sustainability-driven perspective** by integrating  
**ESG principles (Environmental, Social, Governance)** with **Prakriti-based behavioral profiling**.

Instead of evaluating financial health only through income, expenses, or savings, this project focuses on **how human behavior and sustainability awareness shape financial decisions over time**.

The objective is simple:  
to transform raw financial and behavioral data into **clear, actionable insights** that support **long-term, responsible financial well-being**.

This project brings together **finance, behavioral analytics, ESG concepts, and data visualization** into a single, practical analytics solution.

## 2. 🎯 Why I Built This Project
Most financial wellness tools today follow a *one-size-fits-all* approach. They rarely answer deeper questions such as:

- Why do people with similar incomes show very different financial outcomes?
- How do behavioral patterns influence spending, saving, and financial stability?
- Are financial decisions aligned with long-term sustainability goals?
- Can financial wellness analysis be both **personalized and responsible**?

This project was built to explore these questions by combining **behavioral context and ESG thinking** with structured data analytics.

## 5. 🔄 Project Workflow
1. **Problem Understanding**  
   - Identified limitations of traditional financial wellness models  
   - Defined the role of ESG and behavioral integration  

2. **Data Preparation**  
   - Organized financial and behavioral datasets  
   - Cleaned and processed data using Pandas and NumPy  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Studied income, expenses, savings, and spending behavior  
   - Compared patterns across different **Prakriti profiles**  

4. **Prakriti-Based Feature Engineering**  
   - Converted qualitative behavioral traits into numerical indicators  
   - Enabled personalized financial assessment  

5. **Financial Wellness Scoring**  
   - Designed a **rule-based, explainable scoring model**  
   - Combined behavior, lifestyle, and sustainability indicators  

6. **ESG Alignment Analysis**  
   - Evaluated how financial behavior aligns with ESG principles  
   - Identified sustainability-driven financial patterns  

7. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Built **Power BI dashboards** for business-friendly insights  
   - Focused on clarity, usability, and interpretation

## 6. 🧮 Financial Wellness Scoring – How It Works
The financial wellness score is designed to be **simple, transparent, and interpretable**.

It combines three core components:  
1. **Behavioral Stability (Prakriti-based)**  
2. **Lifestyle Discipline** (sleep, meditation, activity indicators)  
3. **Sustainability Awareness** (ESG-related behavior)  

Each component contributes a fixed weight to the final score.  
The goal is **meaningful assessment**, not black-box prediction — making the model suitable for real-world financial and ESG-focused use cases.

---

## 7. 📊 Key Insights
- Financial behavior varies significantly across **Prakriti profiles**  
- ESG-aligned habits are associated with better **long-term financial stability**  
- Behavioral context adds depth beyond traditional financial metrics  
- Visual dashboards help decision-makers quickly understand patterns  

---

## 8. 💼 Business Impact
This project demonstrates how financial institutions, fintech platforms, and wellness-focused organizations can:  

- Improve personalization of financial advisory services  
- Identify behavior-driven financial risks early  
- Align consumer behavior with ESG and sustainability goals  
- Design targeted interventions for long-term financial health  

The scoring framework acts as a **decision-support layer**, making it practical for regulated and ESG-focused environments.
